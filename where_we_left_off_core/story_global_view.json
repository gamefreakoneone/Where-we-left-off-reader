A sudden heavy snowstorm closes Mr. Bucket's toothpaste factory, leaving him unemployed and the household plunged into cold and hunger.

Wonka\u2019s earlier account of the Oompa-Loompas and the Chocolate Room sets the stage for the next mishap: Augustus Gloop disregards warnings, laps from the chocolate river, falls in, and is drawn into a glass pipe that carries him toward the Fudge Room. He becomes briefly stuck and then is propelled out of sight. His parents panic; Wonka responds with a mix of practical action (summoning an Oompa-Loompa escort) and dark humor while reassuring them that Augustus will be safe. As the Gloops head after their son, the Oompa-Loompas on the far bank beat drums and sing a mocking, moralizing song about Augustus\u2019s greed. The incident underscores the factory\u2019s strange systems, Wonka\u2019s control, the Oompa-Loompas\u2019 role as both workers and chorus, and the visitors\u2019 contrasting foibles, leaving Augustus\u2019s immediate fate handled by the factory\u2019s mechanisms and the moral lesson signaled by the song.",

Charlie and Grandpa Joe drink warm river chocolate and revel. The boat rockets into a dark white tunnel, lights are switched on, and passengers glimpse labelled storeroom doors as Wonka jokes and urges the rowers. Parents complain that Wonka is mad; Wonka remains jubilant and suddenly orders the boat stopped as a bright red door appears.",
      "summary_global": "The tour continues after Augustus Gloop's accidental removal from public view into the factory's piping and the Oompa-Loompas' mocking moral song. Wonka next ushers the guests into a large pink boiled-sweet boat manned by scores of Oompa-Loompas for a rapid trip down the chocolate river. Charlie and Grandpa Joe drink warm chocolate from the river and experience delight while Wonka banters, urges the rowers, and lights the tunnel to reveal labeled storeroom doors. The other parents grow alarmed and insult Wonka's conduct. The ride rockets through darkness until Wonka suddenly orders the boat stopped at the sight of a bright red door, raising new curiosity and tension about what lies ahead.",

His frantic parents panic while Mr Wonka comforts them, proposes using a stretch-testing machine and Supervitamin Chocolate to restore Mike, and sends Oompa-Loompas to retrieve and care for the tiny boy. The Oompa-Loompas then sing a long cautionary song condemning television and urging reading instead.",

Wonka demonstrates his Television Chocolate by transmitting a full-sized bar into a tiny, tangible confection on a screen; Charlie participates in the test. Mike Teavee, skeptical and impulsive, rushes into the receiving apparatus, flips the switch and is transmitted into the television \u2014 reappearing as a one-inch-tall boy. His parents panic; Wonka calmly proposes remedies (a stretching machine and Supervitamin Chocolate) and sends Oompa-Loompas to retrieve and care for the tiny child. The Oompa-Loompas march and sing a long moralizing song condemning excessive television and praising reading. The episode reinforces Wonka's control and ingenuity, highlights the real risks of the factory's inventions, shows the Teavees' distress and Mike's recklessness, and emphasizes the Oompa-Loompas' dutiful role as both technicians and chorus.",
